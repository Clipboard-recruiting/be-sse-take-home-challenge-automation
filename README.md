## Summary
Automates creating and archiving a PR interview repository

## Endpoints
`GET /pr-interviews`

`POST /pr-interviews`  
body: `{ username: '<candidate github username>' }`  
Create a new PR interview. Automates creating the repo, inviting the candidate, and creating the pull request for the interview.  

`DELETE /pr-interviews/:repoName`  
Archives a PR interview repo.

`GET /health-check/public`  
`GET /health-check/private`

## Notes
- Requires a local installation of the github cli
- Requires ENV vars to interact with the Clipboard-recruiting Github org (ask @kevcx2 for existing, or create your own personal access token)
- Can run locally (instructions below) or as a docker image
- Deployed to heroku, but can deploy anywhere as a docker image
- Why don't I use repo templates, and why do I use the github CLI to push branches from the template repo to the interview repo?
    - Good question. I wanted to do this originally, but very importantly `Branches created from a template have unrelated histories, which means you cannot create pull requests or merge between the branches.`. This means we cannot create a new repo from a template and then create a pull request between the template branches.
